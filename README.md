# DSA-Capstone-Project
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository documents my learning journey and practical applications of digital skills in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. Each section includes basic functions, use cases, and mini-projects that demonstrate my growing expertise in data analysis with **The Incubator Hub**.

## Microsoft Excel
Excel was my starting point in data analysis. I explored:

#### Key Fuctions
- VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP
- IF, IFS, AND, OR
- SUMIF, COUNTIF, COUNTA, AVERAGEIF
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Data Validation & Cleaning

## SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL helped me interact with databases and extract meaningful insights.

#### Key Commands
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- ALTER, TRUNCATE, DELETE, DROP
- CASE WHEN and Subqueries

## Power BI
Power BI allowed me to visualize data and tell compelling stories.

#### Key Features
- Data modeling with relationships
- DAX formulas: CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, SUMX
- Power Query for Data Transformation
- Interactive dashboards
- Custom visuals and slicers

# Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project
#### Instruction
I was required to select any 2 out of the 3 case studies shared with me for the project.
For each selected case study, I carried out a comprehensive Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the
context of each dataset.

So I chose the following case studies for my project.
- Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
- Case Study 3: Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
