# DSA Projects Documentation
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository documents my learning journey and practical applications of digital skills in Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI. Each section includes basic functions, use cases, and mini-projects that demonstrate my growing expertise in data analysis with **The Incubator Hub**.

## Microsoft Excel
Excel was my starting point in data analysis. I explored:

#### Key Fuctions
- VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP
- IF, IFS, AND, OR
- SUMIF, COUNTIF, COUNTA, AVERAGEIF
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Data Validation & Cleaning

## SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL helped me interact with databases and extract meaningful insights.

#### Key Commands
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- ALTER, TRUNCATE, DELETE, DROP
- CASE WHEN and Subqueries

## Power BI
Power BI allowed me to visualize data and tell compelling stories.

#### Key Features
- Data modeling with relationships
- DAX formulas: CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, SUMX
- Power Query for Data Transformation
- Interactive dashboards
- Custom visuals and slicers

# Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project
#### Instruction
I was required to select any 2 out of the 3 case studies shared with me for the project.
For each selected case study, I carried out a comprehensive Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the
context of each dataset.

So I chose the following case studies for my project.
- Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
- Case Study 3: Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Case Study 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis
#### Company Overview
You are working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. Your team has been
tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

A dataset has been provided for this task.

##### Analysis Tasks
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

##### Final Task: Dashboard Creation
Using your cleaned dataset and pivot outputs, build an Excel dashboard. Unleash your Creativity

## Case Study 3: Palmora Group HR Analysis
#### Company Overview

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.


##### Task 
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to:
● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### Recommendations to address Palmoria Group’s gender equality issues:
1. **Conduct a Gender Pay Audit:**
   - Compare average salaries by gender within the same roles and departments.
   - Identify departments or regions with unjustified pay gaps.
   - Adjust salaries where discrepancies exist.
  
2. **Eliminate Salary Negotiations**
   - Set fixed salary bands for roles and levels.
   - Ensure starting salaries are based on role, not negotiation outcomes.

3. **Standardize Hiring & Promotion Criteria**
   - Use score-based evaluations for interviews and promotions.
   - Ensure job descriptions use gender-neutral language.
   - Require gender-balanced interview panels for all hires.
  
4. **Enforce Balanced Representation Targets**
   - Set targets (e.g. 40% female hires) for underrepresented departments like Engineering or Legal.
   - Monitor female vs. male representation in leadership roles.
  
5. **Establish Gender Equity KPIs**
   - Track and report monthly:
       - Gender distribution by department
       - Gender pay ratios
       - Performance rating trends by gender
   - Use dashboards visible to HR and leadership.
